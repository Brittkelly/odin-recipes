The Odin Project (Foundations Course): Recipes 

INTRODUCTION:
 In this project I will be practicing all the HTML knowledge I have acquired thus far by building a basic recipe website.This website will consist of a main index page with a few links to recipes. Please note, this website will not look pretty at the end of this project. It's just to build my HTML chops. I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
