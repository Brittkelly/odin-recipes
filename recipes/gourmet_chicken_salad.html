    <p>This elegant salad combines tender, juicy chicken breast with a creamy dressing made from
         a mix of mayonnaise and Greek yogurt. Fresh ingredients like crisp celery, red onion, and
          a touch of Dijon mustard are added for crunch and zest. Toasted almonds lend a delightful
           nutty flavor, while dried cranberries introduce a hint of sweetness. Fresh herbs like parsley
            enhance the taste, and a splash of lemon juice brightens the overall flavor. The result is a flavorful,
             refined dish that's perfect as a light lunch or an appetizer.</p>
